# aipi561 ADHD Guardian ðŸ¤–
AHDH Guardian is a web application specifically designed to support professionals and students with ADHD. It aims to mitigate executive function challenges by providing AI-driven task decomposition, prioritization assistance, and positive reinforcement.

## Motivation:
As someone with ADHD myself, along with an estimated 4-5% of adults worldwide with ADHD (approximately 366 million people), initiating and completing tasks can feel like hitting an invisible barrier. This executive function challenge involves difficulties with: 
* Planning and organizing work
* Sequencing steps in logical order
* Prioritizing competing demands
* Overcoming the mental inertia required to simply start
  
## Solution:
ADHD Guardian acts as a non-judgmental, supportive co-pilot specifically designed to help neurodivergent individuals navigate executive function hurdles. 

The application leverages Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) through an AI persona named "Em" to:

Decompose Overwhelm: Users input a task or objective they find daunting
Generate Actionable Steps: Em breaks the task down into 3-5 small, concrete, achievable first steps
Provide Sincere Encouragement: Crucially, Em offers brief, gentle understanding focused only on starting the very first stepâ€”validating the difficulty without judgment
The goal is not to replace planning tools but to provide the scaffolding and dopamine boost needed to overcome initiation paralysis and build momentum.

## Timeline
* Week 1: Ideation. Problem/motivation + solution description + Timeline
* Week 2: Architecture/Component Diagram
* Week 3: Frontend application (Flask, HTML, and Tailwind CSS)
* Week 4: Use Azure OpenAI to breakdown user-inputted tasks and device action steps
* Week 5: Auth (Secure login via Azure AD)
* Week 6: Deployment and CI/CD

## Week 3 & 4 UPDATE

### Developed the front end and backend locally


Create and activate a virtual environment:

# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure your .env file:

# Azure OpenAI
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY="YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="YOUR_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"

# Azure AD App Registration
CLIENT_ID="YOUR_APP_REGISTRATION_CLIENT_ID"
CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_APP_REGISTRATION_CLIENT_SECRET_VALUE"
AUTHORITY="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common" # Or your specific tenant
REDIRECT_PATH="/getAToken"
SCOPE="User.Read Calendars.Read Tasks.Read email" # Required scopes

# Flask Session
SECRET_KEY="generate-a-strong-random-secret-key-here"
Run the application:

flask run --port 5001
Access the application at http://localhost:5001
