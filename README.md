# aipi561 ADHD Helper ðŸ¤–
AHDH Helper is a web application specifically designed to support professionals and students with ADHD. It aims to mitigate executive function challenges by providing AI-driven task decomposition, prioritization assistance, and positive reinforcement.

## Motivation:
As someone with ADHD myself, along with an estimated 4-5% of adults worldwide with ADHD (approximately 366 million people), initiating and completing tasks can feel like hitting an invisible barrier. This executive function challenge involves difficulties with: 
* Planning and organizing work
* Sequencing steps in logical order
* Prioritizing competing demands
* Overcoming the mental inertia required to simply start
  
## Solution:
ADHD Helper acts as a non-judgmental, supportive co-pilot specifically designed to help neurodivergent individuals navigate executive function hurdles. 

The application leverages Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) through an AI persona named "Em" to:

Decompose Overwhelm: Users input a task or objective they find daunting
Generate Actionable Steps: Em breaks the task down into 3-5 small, concrete, achievable first steps
Provide Sincere Encouragement: Crucially, Em offers brief, gentle understanding focused only on starting the very first stepâ€”validating the difficulty without judgment
The goal is not to replace planning tools but to provide the scaffolding and dopamine boost needed to overcome initiation paralysis and build momentum.
